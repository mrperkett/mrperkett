## Introducing myself

Hello, I'm Matt. I am a scientific computing expert specializing in data science, software development, and algorithm development in bioinformatics.

I have spent the last eight years working as a bioinformatician in the biotech industry helping to drive advances in CRISPR and RNAi through research and product development. Before that, I completed a computationally-focused Physics Ph.D. at Brandeis University where I studied [*protein self-assembly and conformational dynamics using rare event simulation methods*](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1616760271).  I also have a background in computer science and computational astrophysics from undergrad studies and research.
